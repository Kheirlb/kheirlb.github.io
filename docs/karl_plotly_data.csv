Software,MATLAB,MATLAB is the only language taught in the SDSU Aerospace Department and is widely used in several of our lab courses. I am extremely proficient with the MATLAB language and IDE and have developed code in my professional job.
Software,Java,Java is the first language I learned and I loved it. I took 3 semester courses with the SDSU Computer Science department that used Java as the primary language. The most impressive work I've done in Java was in my Data Structures course where I implemented product inventory database that used hashes and quicksort.
Software,Python,<a style='color: blue' href='https://github.com/Kheirlb/purethermal1-uvc-capture'>Python</a>
Software,C/C++,
Software,LabView,
Software,FORTRAN,
Software,JavaScript,
Software,Racket,
Software,Linux/Unix,"Started out with Raspbian and eventually became exposed to Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, and more. I know my ways around the linux terminal really well."
Software,Version Control,Significant experience with Git/SVN
CAD,PTC Creo Simulate,Most professional experience I have with CAD is with PTC Creo and Simulate. Have managed professional drawings and large complex assemblies on critical time schedules.
CAD,Solidworks,
CAD,FEMAP NASTRAN,
CAD,Autodesk Inventor,
CAD,Blender,A 3D Animation and Visual Effects software that I keep around as a hobby. My older brother introduced it to me 7 years ago and he ended up turning it into a professional career.
Aerospace,Avionics,
Aerospace,Composites,
Aerospace,Cryogenics,I have significant experience working with Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Nitrogen and have been the Red Team operator filling the rocket for SDSU Rocket Project at several static hot fires.
Aerospace,High Pressure,"I have developed and operated high pressure helium and nitrogen systems, some up to 6000 psi, in several aerospace applications."

Leadership,President SDSU<br> Rocket Project,<a style='color: blue' href='https://www.sdsurocketproject.org/our-team'>President<br>SDSURP</a>
Leadership,Senior Engineer SDSU<br> Rocket Project,
Leadership,Design Lead SDSU<br>Rocket Project,
Leadership,VP of Programming<br> College of Engineering<br> Student Council,
Leadership,Resident Advisor,"I help the SDSU residence halls stay safe and secure, meet with students who have university judicial problems, build an academic environment, and create many hall activities and programs."
Leadership,President Residence<br> Hall Association,My first major leadership position at SDSU. I oversaw a team of 25 people who were responsible of being the student connection between the students living in the residence halls and those in the SDSU administration. I attend 2 regional conferences and 1 national as part of my tenure as President.
Electrical,Breadboards,Actively used breadboards for the past 4 years on various electronics projects. I definitely know what a cheap one is and how annoying the can be.
Electrical,PCBs,I designed a PCB in Eagle CAD several years ago but struggled to find a supplier to print the board. Most of my most recent experience is testing PCBs used by the SDSU Rocket Project team that run FreeRTOS.
Electrical,Soldering,"I've been hobby soldering for about 4 years, working on various personal robotics projects, SDSU Rocket Project Avionics systems, and voltage dividers at Parabilis Space Technologies."
Electrical,Multimeters,"I have been using multimeters my entire life from measuring the resistance on PCBs, checking continuity through cables, to checking my double AA batteries. I am at least experienced enough to know how to measure current without popping the fuse (not really that hard)."
Electrical,Oscilloscopes,Used to measure PWM waves for controlling servos and difference in voltage draw of an R&D igniter.
Electrical,Microohm Meters,Measured resistance of various porous graphite samples for an R&D project.
